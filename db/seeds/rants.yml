    gaijintag: 'Tech Gaijin'
    content: 'The Google Pixel 3 was finally announced and holy hell is it expensive in Japan. It’s great that it’s finally coming to Japan for the first time, but at 120000yen for the base XL model, it’s a bit steep. I really like the phone, but charging that price for a phone with only 4gigs of RAM just feels dirty.'

    title: 'My Boss Is a Dumb Driver'
    gaijintag: 'Annoyed Gaijin'
    content: 'On the road with Kachou all week. He is going 130+ on a highway with 80 signs turned on (because of rain) and either on the phone (handsfree? What is this black magic you speak off? None of that for me!) or has his phone propped up at the 12 o’clock position on the phone (boy, those stocks sure are interesting! I could check them the entire drive). Occasionally, he will find a magical spare hand whilst doing either of the two mentioned above to drink or eat, all the while overtaking other cars on the highway. As soon as it was my turn to drive, I try to turn down his “let me know if you need me to drive again” as much as possible, but frankly I’m not a fan of driving extended periods of time at all.. and we are doing 300-600km a day. Yay.'

    title: 'A Day At School'
    gaijintag: 'Gaijin Teacher'
    content: 'Yesterday I was given two classes when a JTE had to leave sick. Im not supposed to be alone but since this was my first time with these kids, I figured I could do my self intro and itd be fine. First class goes great, all the teachers come by to say theyre proud of me (even more praise than usual for the foreigner).Second class has kids I know from eating lunch. They are sweet and I want to impress them. And the HDMI on my laptop gives out. I have to do my self intro with no pictures and follow up 15 minutes of confused troubleshooting that just looks to them like I was unprepared to be left alone. Worst experience ever. For the first time fully understood a conversation between students today at lunch. It was about the embarrassment of riding the train/bus back from Ikebukuro after buying BL merch and carrying the blue animate bag. I can only understand this godamn language when its on my gay ass terms apparently. The worst part was the temptation to join in the conversation so badly because I KNOW that walk of shame.'

    content: 'Had my first encounter with the NHK guy. He said a bunch of things really fast after I told him I don’t understand him and I don’t speak Japanese. Not sure what I’m going to end up with. Ugh.'

    title: 'Train Dilemma'
    gaijintag: 'Annoyed Gaijin'
    content: 'The young guy (Japanese, early 20s) on the train from Osaka to Kanazawa who was sitting alone in a two person seat, when my (Japanese) wife and I boarded, obviously together, and he did not move across the aisle to another open seat (next to an elderly guy) so that we could sit together. He even looked right at us, as we made the "I guess were not gonna be able to sit together because there arent two open seats" motions. Maybe it just my southern gentleman roots, but thats a dick move.'

    gaijintag: 'Mama Gaijin'
    content: 'Late to the complaint party, but I’ve got two:The Belc supermarket is almost done, and they tried out the parking lights this evening. I just don’t understand the designers of these things. I can think of half a dozen solutions off the top of my head to prevent the GIANT SPOTLIGHT shining right into my window that should have been obvious to anyone with half a brain back when they planned the damn things. We will be having a meeting with them very soon about it, but at this point I’m not sure what exactly they can do about it. Is “light harassment” a thing? I feel like it could be.My kid has started talking, and now will not. Shut. Up. She just said variants of “mama” at me for about 3 minutes straight. Just... “mamma mama maaaama mommy? Momma mama mama.” I’m going to lose it, and I stopped drinking for now so I can’t even drown myself in wine.'

    gaijintag: 'no more rice gaijin'
    content: 'Girlfriend has been getting on my case being “waste” and mottainai.Recent examples includes:Me not finishing my rice bowl 100% clean without leaving any bits of riceMe not drinking the remaining soup of udon after being full from eating everything else and the udon noodlesMe being too full to COMPLETE finish all of my food.Apparently, leaving food or being “mottainai” in regards to food is as bad as spitting in the face of someone :/'
